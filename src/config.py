If a value for a field does not exist or cannot be found in the document, use null for that field.
For the 'issue_date' in 'invoice_metadata', first identify the date in any format present in the document, then convert it to YYYY-MM-DD format.
The 'description' in 'invoice_metadata' should be a natural language summary of the invoice including the invoice number, order ID, date, entities involved, and total price.
Ensure the output is only the structured data as per the schema."""
